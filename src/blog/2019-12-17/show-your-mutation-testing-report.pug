        Running mutation testing can be time-consuming.
        Using your PC to do it is fine for small projects, but for bigger projects, you really want to run it in a CI/CD pipeline.  

        This is also something we've experienced developing Stryker.
        At first, we would run Stryker on Stryker every week.
        But as our codebase grew, this became impractical. 

        Luckily, running mutation testing in your CI/CD pipeline is a trivial task.
        Most mutation testing frameworks can be run from the command line.
        This is also true for the Stryker family of frameworks.
        The problem becomes: what is a convenient way to read the mutation testing report 👀?
        Manually downloading files and opening them in your browser isn't a way anyone should be forced to spend an afternoon.

        ## Meet: Stryker Dashboard
        
        The Stryker Dashboard aims to solve that problem. It's now possible to host your mutation testing report right there. Some examples:
        * [Stryker](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/reports/github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/master)
        * [Stryker4s](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/reports/github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker4s/master)
        * [Stryker.NET](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/reports/github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-net/master)

        ## Where can I get my own? 
        
        Getting up and running with the dashboard is simple. 

        🎯 Navigate to https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io and log in with your GitHub account.  
        ✅ Enable the Stryker Dashboard for your repository.  
        🔑 Configure Stryker to run with the "dashboard" reporter with your personal API key. See [the dashboard article on the Stryker handbook for the details](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/dashboard.md)  
        🏃‍♀️ Run Stryker.NET, Stryker4s or Stryker and upload your first report.

        ## Features
        
        The Stryker Dashboard now has several features out-of-the-box:
        
        💄 Store and show gorgeous reports.  
        🥇 Brag about your mutation score with the mutation score badge in your README.md file.  
        🔀 Support Git workflows out of the box with mutation reports per branch, tag and even hash.  
        🐉 Support for Monorepos out of the box. Multiple reports are aggregated to show a report of all your modules.  
        🤝 Supports all Stryker implementations, as well as other frameworks that support the [mutation-testing-report schema](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements/tree/master/packages/mutation-testing-report-schema).
        It even supports sending your report through a cURL request. See [the Stryker handbook](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/dashboard.md) for more details.  
        💸 Free for open source projects.
        
        ## What's next?

        We'd like to get more mutation testing frameworks on board. Together, we'll be able to spread the word about mutation testing 
        and test quality by making it more visible. Please use the dashboard for your open source projects as well.

        We're looking to improve the dashboard further. You can expect more features and open source git providers to be added. 
        We're always looking for feedback, please don't hesitate to create [an issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-dashboard/issues/new). 

        The latest versions of Stryker, Stryker4s, and Stryker.NET all support the dashboard reporter.
        We are also eating our own dog food here 🍴🐶🥫.
        We welcome PR's to help improve our own Mutation Score through pull requests as well. 
        Improving tests is a good way to get to know a new code base.
